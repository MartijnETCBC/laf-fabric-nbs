# Table of notebooks

## Text
View the text itself, or visualizations of it.

* [plain](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/orgs/ETCBC/teams/blob/master/plain.ipynb)
* [proper](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/orgs/ETCBC/teams/blob/master/proper.ipynb)

Making your own annotation and add them to the data for new analysis.

* [annox_workflow](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/orgs/ETCBC/teams/blob/master/annox_workflow.ipynb)

## Feature Studies
Explorations into the features in the ETCBC text database of the Hebrew Bible.

*Feature-Doc* below is a generic instrument to create a statistical overview of defined and undefined values of features selected by you.
Here you can also find the list of all available features.

The other notebooks contain descriptions of the meanings of certain features and their values,
and they will show you examples, and they will test assertions about them.
For example: *the ``clause_constituent_relation``-feature has value ``none`` for a node if and only if that node has no outgoing edges labeled ``mother``*.

* [feature-doc](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/orgs/ETCBC/teams/blob/master/feature-doc.ipynb)
* [clause_phrase_types](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/orgs/ETCBC/teams/blob/master/clause_phrase_types.ipynb)

# Linguistic Variation
Research into linguistic variation in the Hebrew Bible books.
Datamining, statistics, visualization.

Tree construction.
Correlating morphological features to syntactic functions.

* [trees](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/orgs/ETCBC/teams/blob/master/trees.ipynb)
* [participle](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/orgs/ETCBC/teams/blob/master/participle.ipynb)
