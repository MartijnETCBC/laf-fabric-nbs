IPython notebooks developed for the study of the Hebrew Bible.

> We see some people who are attached to this thing at one time, and attached to something else at another time.
This is like the one who is digging for water, and digs a little here and a little there.
He dies of thirst without finding water.
He is not like the one who digs in one place, trusting and relying on Allah.
He finds water and drinks and lets other people drink.

## Feature Studies
Explorations into the features in the ETCBC text database of the Hebrew Bible.

*Feature-Doc* below is a generic instrument to create a statistical overview of defined and undefined values of features selected by you.
Here you can also find the list of all available features.

The other notebooks contain descriptions of the meanings of certain features and their values,
and they will show you examples, and they will test assertions about them.
For example: *the ``clause_constituent_relation``-feature has value ``none`` for a node if and only if that node has no outgoing edges labeled ``mother``*.
